## Dataset

SegMM_inter_sample.csv is an example of **SegMM**'s interaction data. Due to the space limitation, we sampled 10000 lines from the preprocessed data. The full data will be released by Clouds with interaction (multi-behavior), video segment-level embeddings, and the sampled raw videos. 
Here's the [data details](https://github.com/hezy18/SegMMInterest/blob/main/SegMM.md).

## Codes

* MMinterest is the code for segment-level user dynamic interest modeling and baselines in video-skip prediction
* SegRec is the code for segment-integrated video recommendation
* SkipPredBaseline is the code for recommender baselines in video-skip prediction
* data_process is for the preparation of data in all tasks
